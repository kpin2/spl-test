        <p>In recent years the terms <em><b>blockchain</b></em> and <em><b>crypto</b></em> have become popular buzzwords
            as mainstream adoption of the field continues. The most well-known cryptocurrencies you've probably heard of
            already: <br><b>Bitcoin</b> and <b>Ethereum</b>.<br>
            The important bits to know about what the blockchain is and exactly what it
            does is broken down very well by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain"
                                                    title="Blockchain - Wikipedia">blockchain</a> wikipedia page:

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">
            "A <b>blockchain</b> is a growing list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science)"

            <i>blocks</i>, that are securely linked together using
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography" title="Cryptography">cryptography</a>. Each block
            contains a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"
                          title="Cryptographic hash function">cryptographic hash</a> of the previous block, a <a

            and transaction
            data (generally represented as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree" title="Merkle tree">Merkle

                               title="Node (computer science)">data nodes</a> are represented by leafs). The timestamp
            proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published to get into its hash. As blocks each
            contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block
            reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because
            once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent
            blocks."

        The main takeaway is that the distributed digital ledger structure gives blockchains a very powerful property:
        <b><em>immutability</em></b>.
        <br>This immutability allows users to be in total and complete control over any assets they deposit into their
        crypto wallets. Once a transaction has been confirmed and added to the blockchain, the data within the block
        cannot be changed without changing every preceding block in the chain (a process known as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)"
            title="Fork (software development) - Wikipedia">forking</a>).<br>
        Building on the idea of censorship resistance is the Hive blockchain. A great introductory video courtesy of

        "Splinterlands is the next generation of collectible card
        games. It allows players to collect, trade, and battle with
        provably scarce digital collectibles with real world value.
        Every battle is a unique challenge that consists of
        dynamically created combat rules, a timed team building
        session, and the battle itself.
        Splinterlands combines the collect-ability and resale value
        of physical card games with the convenience and speed
        of a digital game."

        <br>

        Splinterlands achieves this by making every card in the game an NFT, or a
        Non-Fungible Tokens.
        All this really means is that every card in the game is represented by a single token on the
        blockchain, with its own identification numbers. That gives each card a provably unique supply, and owner, with
        all the data backed up the immutable blockchain.
        <br>
        In fact, <b>every action the user makes while playing Splinterlands is actually a transaction on the Hive
        blockchain!</b>
        <br>
        Splinterlands also incorporates its' own cryptocurrencies in the forms of:

        <p>Both tokens were established to bring even more value to the game, though they are vastly different in their
            utilities. Both tokens can be earned by playing, and both can be spent in game. The purpose of these tokens
            is beyond the scope of this website, but those interested should check the SPS documentation linked above or
            the Splinterlands <a href="https://splinterlands.com" title="Splinterlands">website</a> for more
            information.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Splinterlands also features a built-in open marketplace for players to buy, sell, and even rent cards to play
            with. Spare cards that would otherwise be unused can be rented out to other players using this, or any of
            the multiple third party marketplaces, to create a passive income flow. The use of <a
